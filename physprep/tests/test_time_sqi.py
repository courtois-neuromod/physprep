def rac_sqi(signal, threshold, duration=2):
    """
    Compute the Rate of Amplitude Change (RAC) in the signal for windows
    of length defines by `duration`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : vector
        Signal on which to compute the RAC.
    threshold : float
        Threshold to consider to evaluate the RAC. If the RAC is above
        that threshold, the quality of the signal in the given window is
        considered as bad.
    duration : float
        Duration of the windows on which to compute the RAC.
        Default to 2.

    Returns
    -------
    rac_ratio : float
        Ratio between the number of windows above `threshold` and the overall
        number of windows.
